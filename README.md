# Computer-Vision

## Program 1

The program takes six parameters (sx, sy, tx, ty, Î¸, and k) as input from the batch file and transforms an image according to the parameters. The output image hsd the same dimensions as the input image. The program **rotates**, **scales**, **translates**, and **shears** the image based on the parameters. 

## Program 2

The program soothes & detects edges of an image by convolution, linear filtering, and bilinear interpolation.

## Program 3

This program computes a color histogram of the image and additionally, uses multiple OpenCV methods to modify the image. 

## Final Project

A road object detection system was created to spot American regulatory signs (like Traffic Lights, Stop Signs, Pedestrian Signs, and Speed Limit Signs) using image recognition. It was built using OpenCV and C++ on Windows OS. The goal was to boost road safety by spotting these signs in real-time, making city transportation safer.
